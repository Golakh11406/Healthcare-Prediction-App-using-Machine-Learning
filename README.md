# Healthcare-Prediction-App-using-Machine-Learning
A Streamlit-based ML system that predicts diseases from symptoms using Random Forest and provides descriptions and precautions using multiple medical datasets.
This project is a Healthcare Assistance Web Application built using Machine Learning and Streamlit.
It predicts a disease based on the symptoms entered by the user and displays the disease description, precautionary steps, and severity using four integrated datasets.

A Random Forest model trained on a labeled medical dataset is used to classify the disease.
The application follows a clean, modular architecture with separate folders for models, data, utilities, and UI, making it easy to extend and deploy.
