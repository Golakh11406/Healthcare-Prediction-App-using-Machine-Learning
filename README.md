# Healthcare-Prediction-App-using-Machine-Learning
Healthcare Assistance using Machine Learning

A Streamlit-based ML web application that predicts diseases from symptoms and displays detailed descriptions and precautions using four integrated medical datasets.

🚀 Project Overview

This project is a Healthcare Assistance System built using Machine Learning and Streamlit.
The system predicts a disease based on user-input symptoms using a trained Random Forest classifier.
It also displays the disease description, severity, and precautionary steps by integrating four structured medical datasets.

The application follows a modular, scalable structure and is optimized for deployment on GitHub, Streamlit Cloud, or any hosting platform.
